Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes.

Don't wait. The time will never be just right.

You give before you get.

A goal is a dream with a deadline.

You can do it if you believe you can!

No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility.

Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing.
