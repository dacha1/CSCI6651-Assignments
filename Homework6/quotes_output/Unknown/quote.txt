Today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday.

It's easier to see the mistakes on someone else's paper.

Every man dies. Not every man really lives.

The day is already blessed, find peace within it.

From small beginnings come great things.

It takes both sunshine and rain to make a rainbow.

A beautiful thing is never perfect.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Some pursue happiness, others create it.

We do what we do because we believe.

The harder you fall, the higher you bounce.

Everyone smiles in the same language.

You can do what's reasonable or you can decide what's possible.

Friendship isn't a big thing. It's a million little things.

A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.

Someone remembers, someone cares; your name is whispered in someone's prayers.

Don't be pushed by your problems; be led by your dreams.

Change your thoughts, change your life!

Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.

The day always looks brighter from behind a smile.

A stumble may prevent a fall.

Put your future in good hands your own.
